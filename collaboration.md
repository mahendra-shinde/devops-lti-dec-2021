# DevOps : Collaboration
Team Collaboration
* All team member are responsible from Day1
    Dev and Prod Teams should understand the requirements and must communicate to each other.
    Dev Team should do feasibility for BUILDING and Prod Team should do feasibility for DEPLOYMENT.

    Example:
        Dev Team told "prod team" that application would be built in Java 12
        Production Team replied, Java 12 is not LTS (Long term support) and not recommanded for production
        Dev Team said, which version should we use ?
        Production said, why don't use Java 11 which is LTS.


+ Requirements and UAT Expectations must be CLEAR.
    Collaborate with your Customer / Product Owner to understand the requirement.

Developers are more afraid of these things:
1. UAT 
2. Change Request

Requirement:
I am end-user, an accountant / clerk working in XYZ Ltd. No Programming knowledge but i have used MS Excel and i want a simple interest calculator program.
I will enter principle amount, rate of interest (PA) and duration in months. program should return interest amount.

- No one did perform any validation on values?
- Amounts usually entered with "RS 10,000.00"
